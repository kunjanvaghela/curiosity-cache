# Why Automation Testing

-              Saves time and money, faster execution
-              Reusability of code
-              Easy reporting
-              Easy for compatibility testing --> Cross browser/platforms
-              Low-cost maintenance
-              Minimal manual intervention
-              Maximum coverage --> Helps to increase test coverage
-              More powerful and versatile --> Integration with multiple tools & technologies like github, Jenkins etc, cross browser testing
-              Mainly for **Regression testing** only.
