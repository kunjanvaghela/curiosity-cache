## 1. Fundamentals

Defect vs Bug vs Mistake


### Testing Principles:
1) Testing shows presence of defects
2) Exhaustive testing is impossible
3) Early testing
4) Defect clustering
5) Pesticide Paradox
6) Testing is context dependent
7) Absense-of-errors fallacy


### Fundamental Test process

Few terms: **confirmation testing, exit criteria, incident, regression testing, test basis, test condition, test coverage, test data, test execution, test log, test plan, test strategy, test summary report and testware**

1. Test Planning and Control
	1. Determine risks
	2. Determine test approach
	3. Determine resources
	4. Determine exit criteria
2. Test Analysis and design
	1. Test basis
	2. Test Analysis: What to test?
	3. Test Design: How to test?
3. Test Implementation and Execution
4. Evaluating Exit Criteria and Reporting
5. Test Closure Activities




## 2. Testing throughout the Life Cycle

SDLCs:
1. Waterfall Model --> V-Model

2. Iterative Life Cycles --> Agile



### Test Levels
1. Component Testing
	1. Stubs - From the component under test
	2. Driver - Calls the unit under test
2. Integration Testing
	1. Top-down: From GUI/main menu --> Components/systems are substituted by stubs.
	2. Bottom-up: From the bottom of the control flow --> Components/systems are substituted by drivers.
	3. Functional incremental --> on the basis of the functions or functionality, as per functional specification.
3. System Testing
4. Acceptance Testing

### Test Types
1. Functional Testing
	1. Black-box testing
	2. Specification-based
2. Non-Functional Testing
	1. Performance
	2. Load
	3. Stress
	4. Usability
	5. Maintainability
	6. Reliability
	7. Portability
3. Structural Testing
	1. White-box/Glass-box
	2. Code coverage
4. Confirmation and Regression Testing
5. Maintenance Testing
	1. Checks maintainability of a software in production.
	2. Triggers:
		1. Planned modifications
		2. Ad-hoc corrective modifications
	3. Impact Analysis and Regression testing are crucial





## 3. Static Techniques

#### Review Process:

Formal Review Process
1. Planning
2. Kick-off
3. Preparation
4. Review meeting
5. Rework
6. Follow-up

Roles and responsibilities
1. The moderator
2. The author
3. The scribe
4. The reviewers
5. The manager

Types of Review:
1. Walkthrough
2. Technical Review
3. Inspection
