Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.


## Classification of Patterns

### 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

1) [[Factory Method]]
2) [[Abstract Factory]]
3) [[Builder]]
4) [[Prototype]] a.k.a. Clone
5) [[Singleton]]

### 2. Structural Patterns
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

1) [[Adapter]] a.k.a. Wrapper
2) [[Bridge]]
3) [[Composite]]
4) [[Decorator]] a.k.s. Wrapper
5) [[Facade]]
6) [[Flyweight]]
7) [[Proxy]]


### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1) [[Chain of Responsibility]]
2) [[Command]]
3) [[Iterator]]
4) [[Mediator]]
5) [[Memento]]
6) [[Observer]]
7) [[State]]
8) [[Strategy]]
9) [[Template Method]]
10) [[Visitor]]
