- Trained on multiple modalities, e.g., languages and images.
- Can be:
	- autoregressive, e.g., DALL-E, or
	- diffusion-based e.g., Stable Diffusion
- Diffusion models can produce a complex output simultaneously instead of token-by-token.
	- This is difficult to apply to test --> No significant output yet.
- This models can do image-to-text, text-to-image tasks (or both), video generation, audio generation.
