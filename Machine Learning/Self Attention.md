## What is Self-attention?

Self-attention is a mechanism used in machine learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks, to capture dependencies and relationships within input sequences. It allows the model to identify and weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence by attending to itself.
